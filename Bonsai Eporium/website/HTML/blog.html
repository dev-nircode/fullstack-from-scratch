<p class="para"  style="text-align: justify; ">In conclusion, while technology has many benefits, it is important to be aware of its potential drawbacks in order to use it responsibly. We need to find a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of technology in our lives and society as a whole. Technology has had a complex and widespread impact on our lives. On one hand, it has made many aspects of our lives easier by allowing us to communicate more easily, access information, and make advances in healthcare. On the other hand, it has also had some negative effects, such as increased stress, anxiety, and lack of sleep. It has also caused job loss and skill decline as automation and digitalization advances. Additionally, technology can have negative environmental impacts, such as e-waste and energy consumption.
