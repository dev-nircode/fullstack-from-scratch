# fullstack-from-scratch


This repository track my journey learning web development â€” starting from the basics of HTML and CSS, all the way to building full-stack  applications.

The main purpose of creating these repositories is to ensure that I stay productive and learn consistently every day. They help me avoid procrastination and build discipline. I want to document my learning journey from scratch as a way to challenge myself and track my progress over time.

I update this repo regularly as I create new projects and expand my skills.
